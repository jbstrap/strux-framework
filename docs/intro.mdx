# Strux Framework

**A lightweight, attribute-based PHP framework for modern web development.**

Strux abstracts complex backend tasks into **clean, object-oriented interfaces** while staying fast, minimal, and developer-friendly.  
Built for PHP 8.1+, it embraces modern language features without unnecessary overhead.

## 🧠 How Strux Works

Strux encourages a **clean, explicit architecture**:

* Controllers define routes and actions
* Attributes configure behavior
* Services are injected automatically
* ORM handles persistence with minimal boilerplate

Everything stays **close to your code**, not hidden in config files.
